# word_finder
A program that finds all possible words that can be made from a set of letters.

The program consists of a core method word_combinations that recurses to create all possible combinations 
of letters. Once found, each combination is checked with a list of english words in the dictionary.

The dictionary is compiled by entering the words found in a .txt file into a set, so it can be easily searched.

Ignore Xcode Projects directory. It was added to this repository accidentally, I am working on removing it.
